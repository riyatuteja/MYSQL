1.UNION:
The UNION operator is used to combine the result-set of two or more SELECT statements.
 ● Every SELECT statement within UNION must have the same number of columns
● The columns must also have similar data types
● The columns in every SELECT statement must also be in the same order
The UNION operator selects only distinct values by default. 
To allow duplicate values, use UNION ALL
Syntax –
● SELECT column_name(s) FROM table1 UNION
SELECT column_name(s) FROM table2; ● SELECT column_name(s) FROM table1
UNION ALL
SELECT column_name(s) FROM table2;
Ex –
● SELECT City FROM Customers UNION
SELECT City FROM Suppliers ORDER BY City;

2.GROUP BY:
The GROUP BY statement groups rows that have the same values into summary rows, 
like "find the number of customers in each country".
  
 The GROUP BY statement is often used with aggregate functions
(COUNT(), MAX(), MIN(), SUM(), AVG()) to group the result-set by one or more
columns. Syntax –
● SELECT column_name(s) FROM table_name
WHERE condition
GROUP BY column_name(s) ORDER BY column_name(s);
Ex –
● SELECT COUNT(CustomerID), Country FROM Customers
GROUP BY Country
ORDER BY COUNT(CustomerID) DESC;

3.HAVING:
The HAVING clause was added to SQL because the WHERE keyword cannot be used with
 aggregate functions.
*WHERE is given priority over HAVING.
Syntax –
● SELECT column_name(s) FROM table_name
WHERE condition
GROUP BY column_name(s) HAVING condition
ORDER BY column_name(s); Ex –
● SELECT COUNT(CustomerID), Country FROM Customers
GROUP BY Country
HAVING COUNT(CustomerID) > 5;

4.CREATE DATABASE:
The CREATE DATABASE statement is used to create a new SQL database.
  
 Syntax –
● CREATE DATABASE databasename;
5.DROP DATABASE:
The DROP DATABASE statement is used to drop an existing SQL database.
Syntax –
● DROP DATABASE databasename; 
6.CREATE TABLE:
The CREATE TABLE statement is used to create a new table in a database.
Syntax –
● CREATE TABLE table_name ( column1 datatype, column2 datatype, column3 datatype,
.... );
7.DROP TABLE:
The DROP TABLE statement is used to drop an existing table in a database.
Syntax –
● DROP TABLE table_name;
8.TRUNCATE TABLE:
The TRUNCATE TABLE statement is used to delete the data inside a table,
 but not the table itself.
Syntax –
● TRUNCATE TABLE table_name; 

9.ALTER TABLE:
     
The ALTER TABLE statement is used to add, delete, or modify columns in an existing 
table.
The ALTER TABLE statement is also used to add and drop various constraints on an 
existing table.
Syntax –
● ALTER TABLE table_name
ADD column_name datatype;
● ALTER TABLE table_name
DROP COLUMN column_name;
● ALTER TABLE table_name
MODIFY COLUMN column_name datatype;
Ex –
● ALTER TABLE Customers ADD Email varchar(255);
● ALTER TABLE Customers DROP COLUMN Email;
● ALTER TABLE Persons
ALTER COLUMN DateOfBirth year;
